\section{Changing signatories}

You need to change signatories every year. This basically means you let the bank know who the current committee members are, and set things up so they can make withdrawals and all that.

SAGA generally requires two signatories to make a transaction, which means no one can run off with all the cash. Kiwibank is able to do this even with online transactions, as long as all the committee members are members of Kiwibank. You can generally sign up in about ten minutes as long as you have some form of photo ID (driver's licence or passport) and proof of address (\eg a bank statement from another bank).

You'll need to make an appointment at a nearby Kiwibank branch to change signatories. Make sure that all new committee members can turn up as well as at least two current signatories. You should be able to get ex-committee-members removed from the list of signatories, and new members added.
