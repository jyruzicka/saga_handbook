\section{Affiliation}

Affiliation is a tricky business, usually because the UCSA keeps changing affiliation policy. The current affiliation policy is available online\footnote{http://ucsa.org.nz/media/uploads/2012\_01/AFFILIATION\_POLICY\_-\_Nov\_2011.pdf}, but it's also worth checking the UCSA's club documents page\footnote{http://ucsa.org.nz/clubs/documents/} to check that it's current.

Current policy states that re-affiliation should take place by November 30th: this means that you should be planning to re-affiliate near the end of the academic year. The following are required of a UCSA-affiliated club:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The president be either a current student or a member of the UoC alumni association
  \item The club must have at least twenty UoC students as members
  \item The club's members must be at least one-half students
\end{itemize}

It's generally been found useful to have the student ID numbers of student members: this is our way of ensuring that they are indeed students. The club has got into problems previously because they didn't have members' student IDs, even though this is not technically required.
