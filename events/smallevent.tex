\section{Running a small event}

Once you have run Buckets of Dice, running a smaller event is pretty much the same except less so. Small events may include:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Board gaming competition/afternoon
  \item Day-long roleplaying convention
  \item Live action
\end{itemize}

Here are some things you might want to think about when you organise a small event:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Will you be charging entry fees?
  \item Will it be open to everyone, or just for SAGA members?
  \item Will you advertise it at all?
  \item Do you need to provide food?
  \item Will you need to print anything off for this?
\end{itemize}

You can generally get cheap or free booking through the UCSA. If you talk to the current club representative you should  be able to get a club booking form, which will allow you to book a venue for the event.
