\section{Running a Special General Meeting}

In general you shouldn't need to hold a special general meeting (SGM), but sometimes you don't have a choice. You might need to hold an SGM because:

\begin{itemize}
  \item You want to change the constitution but don't want to wait for the AGM
  \item A member of the committee has resigned, and you need to replace them
  \item You want to remove a committee member from their position
\end{itemize}

SGMs are very similar to AGMs, except that the conditions for holding one are a bit more stringent.  Section 7 of the SAGA constitution gives you guidelines on SGMs.
