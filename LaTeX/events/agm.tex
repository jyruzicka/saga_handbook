\section{Running an Annual General Meeting}
\label{sec:agm}

SAGA is required to hold an Annual General Meeting (AGM) every year. The purpose of the AGM is to review the year just gone and elect committee members for the next year.

As of the time of writing, the AGM must be held in the third term and must be advertised to the club at least two weeks prior to the meeting itself. You must get at least fifteen people for your meeting (or 25\% of membership, whichever is fewer) to reach quorum, otherwise it will need to be rescheduled.

At an AGM you might want to have:

\begin{itemize}
  \item A president's report
  \item A treasurer's report
  \item Changes to the AGM (as appropriate)
  \item Election of next year's committee
\end{itemize}

The secretary should be taking minutes of the AGM.

\subsection{Shoulder-tapping}

It's a good idea to think about who should be on next year's committee before the AGM. If you know anyone who'd be a good committee member, maybe you want to catch up with them before the meeting and ask if they'd considered it.

It's good to have one or two people on the committee who've done the job before, and two or three new people. While it can be good to have the same committee two years in a row, this generally means it's more likely that they all retire or leave University at once, leaving you with an inexperienced committee.

Section 6 of the SAGA constitution gives you guidelines on AGMs.
