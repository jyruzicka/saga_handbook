\section{The President}

The president is the figurehead of the committee --- they must function as both the public and organisational head of the club. The president must outline the general direction of the club and allocate time and resources to their goals, as well as keeping up with all the regular tasks that are required for the club. A motivated and active president can guarantee a successful year for the club; a forgetful or detached one can cause the club to stagnate, and results in an unsatisfactory experience for all.

\subsection{In Depth}

\subsubsection{Making an annual plan}

The president decides what the club will be doing on a large scale. It is possible, without any great direction, to run the club, but this will result in a dull year with very little to entice new players. Events like Buckets of Dice, any other conventions, games days, and so forth should be planned at the beginning of the year (the sooner the better), and venues booked as early as possible.

The president has a wonderful opportunity to push for events that they want to see happen. Smaller conventions during other term holidays, gaming afternoons, or the running of regular events are all wonderful ways to increase activity within the club, and the president is in the position to help these events happen.

\subsubsection{Booking rooms for regular play and BoD}

Rooms need to be booked as early as possible, both for week-to-week play and for Buckets of Dice. As of the time of publication, SAGA's regular bookings are Tuesday and Thursday evenings in Kirkwood Village.

Buckets of Dice needs to be booked as soon as possible. See also Section~\ref{sec:buckets_of_dice}.

\subsubsection{Gaining affiliation with the UCSA}

This must be done as early as possible. It is important to give the UCSA a list of members and student IDs, as well as a break-down of how many female, male and student members the club has. Affiliation gives the club a priority on room booking and should also help with getting grants from the UCSA.

\subsubsection{Organising clubs day}

Clubs Day should be organised pretty early, although getting people on desk can wait until the week before. Make sure you've booked with the UCSA for clubs day before the event --- in general, getting in touch with them as soon as possible is advisable. For more information, see Section~\ref{sec:clubs_day}

\subsubsection{Overseeing Buckets of Dice}

The president needs to make sure that preparations for Buckets of Dice go smoothly, either in person or by appointing a subcommittee to organise it. Details on organising BoD can be found in Section~\ref{sec:buckets_of_dice}.

\subsubsection{Organising regular committee meetings}

Especially in the lead-up to the start of the year and before BoD, the president needs to make sure that the committee meets regularly to discuss plans and progress. This is a chance for the president to check up on any tasks they've delegated, and assign people tasks.

\subsubsection{Delegating tasks to other committee members}

The president has a committee for a reason. If the president does every task on this list (as well as hold down a paying job or study) they are likely to burn out by mid-June. Instead, the president should use their committee to do their dirty work for them. It's vital also to follow up on committee members once you've delegated them work, and ensure that they're doing what they should be.

\subsubsection{Running an AGM}

At the end of the year, the president should organise an Annual General Meeting for the election of next year's committee and any modifications to the Constitution. This AGM should be advertised at least two weeks prior to the AGM itself. An agenda should also be circulated, and any proposed changes to the constitution made available to club members before the meeting. More information on running an AGM is available on p~\pageref{sec:agm}.
