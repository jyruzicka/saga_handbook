\section{Quartermaster}
\label{sec:quartermaster}

The quartermaster is in charge of the club's assets - mainly board and role-playing games. The quartermaster should keep an eye out on what games get played, and what games the club doesn't have that members would like access to.

\subsection{Key Tasks}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Oversee loans from the club
  \item Organise purchase of new assets
  \item Prepare an inventory
\end{itemize}

\subsection{In Depth}

\subsubsection{Oversee loans from the club}

It is the quartermaster's job to record any items that are loaned to club members and ensure that these items come back. It is recommended that the quartermaster record the member's telephone number along with their student ID when the item it loaned, so that if necessary they can get in contact with the member later. It is also recommended that the quartermaster ensure all loans are returned at the end of the term. You should check that assets are returned in the condition they were loaned in.

\subsubsection{Organise purchase of new assets}

New boardgames or role-playing games will help ensure people will come back to the club. It's up to the quartermaster to decide what games the club should buy. You'll need to talk with the Treasurer regarding how much you can spend. In general, board games will get more used than source books for role-playing games, however mainstream games (\eg D\&D) get played enough that it's generally worth purchasing the core books when they come out.

\subsubsection{Prepare an inventory}

It's a good idea to know what's in the club's lockers and what condition it's in. It is recommended that the quartermaster take an inventory of the lockers sometime early in the year, to determine if any games are missing or unplayable.
