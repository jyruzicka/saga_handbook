\section{Secretary}
\label{sec:secretary}

The secretary has two main roles: to keep records of the club's activities, and to act as the face of the club.

\subsection{Key Tasks}
\label{sub:secretary_key_tasks}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Liaise with the UCSA
  \item Liase with sponsors
  \item Organise committee meetings
  \item Keep minutes for the committee
  \item Keep records of membership
  \item Enable communication between committee members
  \item Maintain the club's incorporated status
  \item Deal with rule changes
  \item Hold the common seal
\end{itemize}

\subsection{In Depth}

\subsubsection{Liaise with the UCSA}

The secretary is the main gateway between the club and external agencies. As such it is their job to make contact with other organisations and people early in the year, and keep in contact with them. The main organisation you will be talking with will be the UCSA --- get in touch with the Clubs Development Officer (their email address should be on the UCSA website) early, in order to arrange the following:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Room bookings throughout the year
  \item Booking a table at Clubs Day
  \item Affiliation (after clubs day)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Liase with sponsors}

It's your job to keep in contact with our sponsors. Talk to last year's committee to see who you should be talking to regarding sponsorship, and email them to make sure our agreements are still current. If you're holding a big event, you may want to see if your sponsors want to help out (with prizes, discounts to attendees, \etc).

\subsubsection{Organise committee meetings}

The secretary is also responsible for setting and organising committee meetings. It is recommended that the committee meet soon after the AGM in order to organise those things that need organising right away (see Chapter~\ref{cha:events}). Committee meetings will also be needed throughout the year so that members can update each other on what progress has been achieved.

\subsubsection{Keep minutes for the committee}

Hand in hand with the previous task, the secretary must keep minutes of these meetings so that three weeks later, everyone can remember what was discussed. You will also need to keep minutes for other meetings such as the AGM.

\subsubsection{Keep records of membership}

The club needs a current membership list for affiliation reasons. You will get one of these by collecting information at clubs day form your new members, but you also need to keep track of new signups throughout the year.

\subsubsection{Enable communication between committee members}

It's your job to make sure that the president is meeting with their committee often enough, and that everyone knows what everyone is doing. The committee mailing list (currently saga-committee@groups.google.com) is designed so that committee members have a way of contacting the rest of the committee. It is the job of the secretary to make sure that they are given administrator privileges from the previous secretary, and that the rest of the committee is added to the list.

\subsubsection{Maintain the club's incorporated status}

SAGA Inc. is an incorporated society, which means we're registered with the New Zealand Companies Office. This has a number of benefits, but we also have to do things to maintain our status. More information on what being an incorporated society means, see Section~\ref{sec:incorporation}.

\subsubsection{Deal with rule changes}

Occasionally, members of the club may wish to change the club rules (also known as the club constitution). These rules detail how people may join the club, how they may be asked to leave the club, how the club should operate, what the club should aim to do, and how to change the rules themselves.

Members may change the rules at a general meeting, but it's not that easy - see the club's rules (version at time of printing: Section~\ref{sec:constitution}) for more detail. If the club passes a rule change, it's the secretary's job to make sure that the relevant people get notified. Here, relevant people means the Societies Office.

I discuss the process by which rules changes occur in Section~\ref{sec:rulechanges}.

\subsubsection{Hold the common seal}

This job is more for the constitution than anything else, but it is the secretary's job to hold the common seal of the club. This seal is occasionally used for signing official paperwork.
