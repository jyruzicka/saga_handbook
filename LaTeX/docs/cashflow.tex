\section{Cashflow}
\label{sec:cashflow}

This is a sample cashflow record for the treasurer. This document is there so you can keep track of where the club has spent money, nothing more: no one need ever see this document except the treasurer. When it comes to the end of the year, when you have to make a financial report, you'll be glad that you have something like around so you know exactly how much the printing of \textit{Out of Character} back in February cost.

The Profit/Loss column is simply calculated as income minus expenses.
