\section{Facebook page}

SAGA's Facebook page is how most of its members communicate with each other. Since its inception it has taken over from the old mailing list as the main way SAGA members communicate with each other.

Current SAGA committee members should be managers of this page. This allows them to post as SAGA Inc. and gives them a few other privileges that can be handy.
