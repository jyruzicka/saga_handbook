\section{Incoporated status}

We didn't just get the ``Inc.'' at the end of our name by wishing: SAGA Inc. is officially an incorporated society. This is handy as it means that if the club goes massively into debt, the committee members are not personally liable. There are probably some other law-related advantages too, but that's beyond my expertise.

As an incorporated society, we have a couple of obligations:

\begin{itemize}
  \item To keep a constitution (technically a set of rules)
  \item To submit financial statements annually
\end{itemize}

All incorporated society paperwork can be done through the Societies website\footnote{http://www.socities.govt.nz}. While the interface is a little antiquated, it still works. Here are some things you may want to do on the Societies website:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Change details (you should do this every year)
  \item File a financial statment
  \item Change the rules of the society
\end{itemize}
