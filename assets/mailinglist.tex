\section{Mailing list}

SAGA Inc. has an account with MailChimp, a mass-emailing service that lets you send very pretty html emails to your members. It's pretty easy to send something quite good-looking, and it lets you get emails out to your members as often as you need with relatively little effort.

The Promotions Officer should be in charge of mailing the club, although again if they don't feel qualified to do this (and don't want to learn) someone else could take the role. This mailing list should probably be used sparingly as people dislike weekly emails from clubs it seems. You may also wish to let people know we'll send them occasional emails when they give us their email address.

MailChimp is a nice internet citizen and includes an unsubscribe link at the bottom of each email they send out, so you don't need to worry about people complaining to you that they can't stop these emails coming.
