\section{Budget}

In this section I've included a couple of financial documents for Buckets of Dice: a preliminary budget, and an income and expenditure statement.

The budget is what you plan before the event. It doesn't need to be super-detailed, but it does need to be a decent estimate that people can stick to: if you find yourself massively overshooting your budget in one category, it should give you a chance to work out \textit{why}, and see if you can cut back.

The income and expenditure statement should be made right after Buckets of Dice. Since you've recorded all of your expenses and all of your income (you did that, right?) you can work out where you over- and under-spent, which will be a handy record for future years.
